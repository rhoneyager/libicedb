This LXD image provides the libicedb package and all of its dependencies.
You should create a user acount using the `adduser' command. A base copy
of the libicedb package will automatically be copied into the user's
home directory.

This copied git repository should be probably updated by the end user.
Instructions to do this are copied into each user's home directory, in
the 'README' file.

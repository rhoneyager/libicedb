<div class="textblock"><p>Throughout the icedb source and headers, you might have noticed that the code is peppered with objects in the gsl namespace - entities like gsl::not_null and gsl::span. The <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL">Guideline Support Library</a> is a library that contains functions and types that are suggested for use by the <a href="https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines">C++ Core Guidelines</a> that are maintained by the <a href="https://isocpp.org/">Standard C++ Foundation</a>. Icedb aims to follow these best practices, and adherence to these guidelines should help ensure that the code is long-lasting and portable.</p>
<p>The gsl headers are located in the icedb/compat/gsl subdirectory. They are released under the MIT license, and are redistributed here because they are not widely distributed to different platforms.</p>
<h2>Summary of the Different GSL Templates and Macros in Icedb</h2>
<h3>gsl::not_null&lt;T&gt;</h3>
<p>C and C++ pointers may be used:</p><ul>
<li>To pass a single object by address</li>
<li>To indicate arrays</li>
<li>To provide "output" parameters to functions</li>
<li>To indicate "optional" parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>This is horribly vague, and it leads to programming mistakes. gsl::not_null&lt;T&gt;(obj) ensures that obj is a non-null pointer. It checks at runtime, and throws an error if a null pointer is encountered. By placing this check in the declaration of a function, the check is consistently performed. This is also an aid to debugging, whereby you can easily ensure that a null pointer does not enter into a group of nested, high performance functions.</p>
<p>Of course, it does not check against passing an uninitialized pointer. Smart pointers (or a smart compiler with all warnings enabled) can help mitigate this.</p>
<h3>gsl::span&lt;T&gt;</h3>
<p>This allows you to safely pass a range of objects to a function.</p>
<ul>
<li>A common, unsafe, way to pass an array of objects to a function is to just use a NULL-terminated pointer. But, what if you do not remember to ensure NULL-termination?</li>
<li>You could also pass a pointer to the start of an object, along with a size parameter. However, you the size variable is decoupled from the actual array, which allows for mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why C++ has iterators. However, iterators are usually employed only in standard object containers. We could require that the passed objects be withing a standard container, like a std::vector, but then we are forcing library users into our programming style. Sometimes, a vector is not the appropriate container, and we want to avoid excessive re-shuffling and copying of objects.</p>
<p>A gsl::span&lt;T&gt; object has iterators, size(), begin() and end() functions. They are trivially constructable.</p>
<h3>gsl::owner&lt;T&gt;</h3>
<p>Dynamically-allocated memory should be freed when it is no longer in use. Smart pointers, like std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt; and std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; provide facilities for freeing an object when its last reference is gone. However, smart pointers are not always appropriate.</p>
<p>gsl::owner&lt;T&gt; provides a way for a programmer to keep track of how ownership of a pointer should transfer between function calls.</p>
<h3>Expects(...)</h3>
<p>This is a better version of assert. It is always useful to check assumptions, and using Expects helps to clarify your intent to others who may read your code.</p>
<h3>Ensures(...)</h3>
<p>This is similar to Expects, but expresses an assert call as a post condition. That is, at the end of a function, the condition must be respected or an error will occur. </p>

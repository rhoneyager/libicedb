## Description

The Earth's atmosphere contains many small liquid and solid particles. 
The most obvious example of this is in clouds, which are made up of many small ice crystals and water droplets.
These particles each scatter light in different ways; scattering is complicated process that depends on particle structural features (i.e. a particle's shape),
the local environment (temperature), and the characteristics of the observing system (e.g. the frequency, and the angle of the particle relative to the detector).
icedb is a library that manages this particle scattering data. It is designed to be an interface for manipulating data that follows a NetCDF-based scattering 
database format that was developed over 2016-2017 by Stefan Kneifel et al. and discussed at the
[1st International Summer Snowfall Workshop](http://www.geoverbund-abcj.de/SharedDocs/Meldungen/GEOVERBUND/EN/20170719_1st-summer-snowfall-workshop.html).

summary: Various ways to communicate and exchange data among developers

1. Data Exchange, FTP server
  In order to share/exchange data and code, an open ftp server (current space limit 100 GB) is provided by Uni. Cologne: 
    1. ftp gop.meteo.uni-koeln.de
    2. user: libscat
    3. pwd: ask Stefan or Davide

2. Mailing List  
  In order to simplify email communication, we also set up a mailing list for all people involved in the regular skype meetings:
    1. **<meteo-scattdiscuss@uni-koeln.de>**
    2. You can easily subscribe/unsubscribe and change other setting [here](https://lists.uni-koeln.de/mailman/listinfo/meteo-scattdiscuss)
    3. For more specific code discussions we set up a second mailing list called <meteo-scattcode@uni-koeln.de> change your settings for this list by following this [link](https://lists.uni-koeln.de/mailman/listinfo/meteo-scattcode)
    
3. Website to the public
  University of Cologne is still running [snowport.org](http://snowport.org)  
  The website is getting attention from web search engines (i.e. google), it might be a good opportunity to increase visibility of your work

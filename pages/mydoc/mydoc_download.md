## Download icedb

First download or clone icedb from the [Github repo](https://github.com/rhoneyager/libicedb). Development is ongoing, so cloning the repository probably makes the most sense. However, for anyone unexperienced with git, GitHub or version control, you might just want to download a ZIP file containing the latest copy of the source code. In this case, click the **Clone or download** button, and then click **Download ZIP**.

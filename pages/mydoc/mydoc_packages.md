## Get icedb pre-packaged 

On certain operating systems, pre-packaged versions of icedb are available. 
This is the easiest way to get started, but it is also the least customizable. 
If you only want to run the example binaries, then this option is best. 
If you want to link your own code against icedb, then this option is okay. 
If you want to develop icedb or greatly extend its functionality, then skip 
to the next section.

For now, packages are released on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/rhoneyager/libicedb/releases).

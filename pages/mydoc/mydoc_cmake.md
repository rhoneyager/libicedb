CMake is a tool for generating build scripts. Every development environment is set up in a different way. Files may be located in different places. Packages may have different versions. Different compilers may be used. Different operating systems provide different features to end-user programs. CMake accounts for all of these differences, and produces sets of building instructions that will work for your particular platform.

In case you have never used CMake before, you might want to take a look at [it's website](http://cmake.org) and these tutorials for end-users using the [console](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLvZTyji_Uw) and a [GUI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAiuLHy4dCk).
